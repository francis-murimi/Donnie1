                    <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from a personâ€™s weight and height. It is used as a screening tool to classify whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Although it does not directly measure body fat, BMI provides a reliable estimate for most people.

                    <h2>How is BMI Calculated?</h2>
                    <p>
                        BMI is calculated using the following formula:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>BMI = Weight (kg) / [Height (m) x Height (m)]</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if a person weighs 70 kilograms and their height is 1.75 meters, their BMI would be:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>BMI = 70 / (1.75 * 1.75) = 22.86</strong>
                    </p>

                        <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> BMI between 25 and 29.9</li>
                        <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> BMI between 30 and 34.9</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme Obesity:</strong> BMI of 35 and above</li>

            <h2>What Should You Do Based on Your BMI?</h2>
            <p><strong>If your BMI is under 18.5:</strong> This suggests you are underweight. It's important to eat a balanced diet rich in calories and nutrients. Consider speaking with a healthcare professional to evaluate your overall health.</p>

            <p><strong>If your BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9:</strong> You have a normal, healthy weight. Maintain your current lifestyle by staying active and eating a balanced diet to preserve your health.</p>

            <p><strong>If your BMI is between 25 and 29.9:</strong> This indicates you are overweight. You may need to adopt healthier eating habits and increase physical activity to reduce your weight and improve your health.</p>

            <p><strong>If your BMI is 30 or higher:</strong> This classifies as obesity, which increases the risk of serious health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Consult with a healthcare provider to explore weight loss strategies, including diet changes and physical activity plans.</p>
